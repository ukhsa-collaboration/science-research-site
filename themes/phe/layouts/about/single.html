          Science and research are at the core of our mission to protect health
          from infectious disease and environmental hazards. To succeed at
          tackling the major challenges that we face including new and emerging
          infections of high consequence or pandemic potential, climate change,
          air pollution and antibiotic resistance, we need to strengthen our
          scientific capabilities and the impact from our scientific work.

          The overarching research remit, strategy and portal (providing access
          to staff details and publications) relate to all areas of activity
          within Public Health England as predecessor organisation. The period
          of transition to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) will see a
          gradual focussing onto health protection research activities,
          including those from NHS Test and Trace.

        <p>
          Our scientific work will span the breadth of our mission. We will find
          solutions to public health problems and accelerate their
          implementation. We continually evolve adopting new methods and best
          practice from exploratory science (e.g. understanding mechanisms of
          resistance to antibiotics to inform the development of new
          antimicrobials) to research to develop and evaluate interventions and
          understand how to best implement control programmes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will create the ecosystem for a thriving multidisciplinary
          community of scientists and analysts with access to facilities,
          resources, high quality data and technology to deliver the country’s
          strategic needs. We will attract and develop the scientific leaders
          and capabilities of the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          A new Science and Research Strategy to realise UKHSA’s vision is under
          development.
